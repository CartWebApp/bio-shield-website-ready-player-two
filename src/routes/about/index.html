    <h1>About</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Bio-Shield was founded with a simple belief: <br />
        <strong
            >Protecting people from bugs shouldn't come at the cost of harming
            the planet.</strong
        >
        Too many repellents on the market relied on harsh chemicals, synthetic
        fragrances, and toxic additives that raised health and environmental
        concerns. Recognizing the need for a safer alternative, our founders set
        out to create an effective solution rooted in nature.
        <br />

        <br />
        From the beginning, Bio-Shield focused on blending all-natural,
        plant-based ingredients known for their bug-repelling properties.
        Drawing on traditional remedies and modern research, we developed a
        formula that not only worked but was safe for families, pets, and the
        environment.<br />

        <br />
        After extensive testing and refinement, Bio-Shield launched its first
        eco-friendly bug repellent, which quickly gained attention for its
        fresh, clean scent and reliable protection. Customers loved that it
        offered peace of mind without the trade-offs of conventional sprays.
        <br />
        <br />
        Over the years, Bio-Shield has continued to grow, expanding its product
        line and deepening its commitment to <strong>sustainability</strong>.
        From responsibly sourced ingredients to recyclable packaging, every
        choice we make is guided by our mission: to provide
        <strong
            >effective, natural protection while preserving the health of people
            and the planet</strong
        >.<br /><br />
        Today, Bio-Shield is proud to be part of the movement toward a greener,
        safer futureâ€” one bottle at a time.
